                    What is the one philosophy that drives <em><b><font color="#CC9933"><a href="#Scaal">SCAAL?</a></font></b></em> 
                      We believe that no matter where you go, you should always be able to enjoy 
                      the simple pleasure of a good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. 
                      At home, reading the morning paper. At your local <em><b><font color="#CC9933">SCAAL</font></b></em>, 
                      conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in some foreign land, <em><b><font color="#CC9933">SCAAL</font></b></em> 
                      will be greeting you like an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual 
                      that transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel alert, energetic 
                      and alive.</font></p>

                      Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in Marstrand, 
                      Sweden. As a child, he listened to stories of his grandfather Oluf’s adventures 
                      and expeditions. Often his grandfather would bring back exotic coffees 
                      for the family to enjoy. </font></p>

                      his graduation Anders left home to see the world. He worked all kinds 
                      of odd jobs. He worked in parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He 
                      worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in a few years, 
                      Anders learned the art of selecting the perfect coffee bean and roasting 
                      it to perfection. </font></p>

                      standards for coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB – strictly 
                      hard bean or strictly high grown – coffee beans. To ensure their flavorful 
                      oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee

                      are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary

                      is your best choice. The quality begins at harvest. <em><b><font color="#CC9933">SCAAL</font></b></em> 
                      relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive process that involves making 
                      several passes among the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. 
                      Then we select top grade SHB, which stands for strictly hard bean or strictly 
                      high grown. Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above 
                      sea level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee to you, 
                      the beans are roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified Roastmaster 
                      and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma.</font></p>
