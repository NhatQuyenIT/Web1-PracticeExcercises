                    We believe that no matter where you go, you should always be able to enjoy
                    the simple pleasure of a good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment.
                    At home, reading the morning paper. At your local SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in
                    some foreign land, SCAAL
                    will be greeting you like an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual
                    that transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel alert, energetic
                    and alive. </p>

                <h2 style="color: #808000;">Where we began</h2>
                <p align="left" style="font-size: 20px;color:black;">Anders
                    Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in Marstrand,
                    Sweden. As a child, he listened to stories of his grandfather Oluf’s adventures
                    and expeditions. Often his grandfather would bring back exotic coffees
                    for the family to enjoy. <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the world. He worked all kinds
                    of odd jobs. He worked in parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He
                    worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in a few years,
                    Anders learned the art of selecting the perfect coffee bean and roasting
                    it to perfection. <br>
                    <br>
                    He returned home in 1980 to open the first SCAAL
                    in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique blends of coffee and
                    a stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the place to gather – day or night – not only in
                    Stockholm, Sweden, but 670 cities around the world.
                </p>

                <h2 style="color: #808000;" id="Scaal">What makes SCAAL the best coffee?</h2>
                <p align="left" style="font-size: 20px;color:black;">
                    Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned as an apprentice in the coffee
                    fields to every buyer, roaster, and franchise owner. SCAAL's
                    standards for coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB – strictly
                    hard bean or strictly high grown – coffee beans. To ensure their flavorful
                    oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee
                    bean from heat, light, air and moisture. <br>
                    <br>
                    All these efforts are made so that we may offer you a perfect cup of coffee. <br>
                    <br>
                    There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary
                    efforts to ensure that SCAAL is your best choice. The quality begins at harvest. SCAAL
                    relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive process that involves making
                    several passes among the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe.
                    Then we select top grade SHB, which stands for strictly hard bean or strictly
                    high grown. Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above
                    sea level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee to you,
                    the beans are roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified Roastmaster
                    and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma.
